BASIC USAGE

To start using tcpanon, just run:

   	 ./tcpanon.py infile

where "infile" is the input file (in PCAP format) containing the trace to
anonymize.  The output is a PCAP file ("infile.anon" by default) with the
packet payloads fully anonymized.  

Run

	./tcpanon.py -h

for the complete set of options.

If no other options are specified, the program obfuscates the following
clear-text protocols: HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, FTP, FTP-data. Instructions to
anonymize other protocols can be easily added as external modules (or classes).

The user can specify the anonymization level of each application protocol by
editing the configuration file "tcpanon.config". Given a clear-text application
protocol, the config file allows the user to: 

- Keep fields not anonymized. For instance, the instruction "Host: ALL" applied
to 'Host: 192.168.1.1' gives 'Host: 192.168.1.1'

- Erase only the sensitive information about the host, and leave the name of
fields in clear text. The instruction "Host: TAG" applied to 'Host:
192.168.1.1' gives 'Host: xxxxxxxxxxx' 

- Blindly remove all the payload information. The instruction "Host: NONE"
applied to 'Host: 192.168.1.1' gives 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
